# TodoMVC (BackboneJS, RequireJS, Handlebar & Stylus)

This is another TodoMVC, architected with BackboneJS & RequireJS. Template engine used is Handlebar,
and Stylus for modular css. Initially BackboneJS TodoMVC was taken and modularized it by using requireJS.
After that i added stylus and handlebars to make things more easier for scalibility. Grunt is also added
to compile stylus into css and minify it respectively, While app runs on nodejs server.
